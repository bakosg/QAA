Given an html page, where we want to define some element in a special way written in XML.
Feel free to visit the page in Google Chrome and use Developer Tools (F12) to see the same in a better format than the following image.
For UI automation we must identify the elements somehow. In our tool we can do that with XML format:
<button id="petsButton" attribute:id="navigation__pets" />
where 
- 'button' is the html tag we are referring to
- 'id' is the local name we are going to use in our tool, that should be unique following naming conventions of variable (camelCase)
- 'attribute:id' is the id attribute in the html what we are using as a condition.
While defining condition(s), it is really important to identify a single element in the html dom.
So this xml describes the Pets button on the UI using this part of the html
<button _ngcontatn-htth-c204 mat-button id="navigation__pets" routerlink="/pets" class="mat-focus-indicator mat-button mat-button-base" tabindex="0">
